Our 3 personas are a user that can access their data, a movie submitter that has access to the movies they submit, and
analyst that can access all information about the users, movie submitters, and the movies in the database. The names of
each of our files refer to which user we are giving access to. So user_data refers to the GET/POST requests pertaining
to the user, same with submitter_data and analyst_data.
